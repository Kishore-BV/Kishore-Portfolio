								<p>During my internship at Garuda Aerospace from June 2024 to July 2024, I had the invaluable opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects in the Research & Development department. Under the esteemed guidance of Dr. Daniel Lawrence, a distinguished expert in aerospace technology, I contributed to the development of an automated Solar Panel Cleaning Drone. This project aimed to enhance the efficiency of solar panels by using lightweight drones equipped with high-pressure water nozzles for cleaning. My responsibilities included prototyping, flight testing, and the integration of various assembly components. The hands-on experience of assembling the drone and testing its flight capabilities provided me with practical insights into drone technology and automation.

									I was also involved in the development of an Industrial Inspection Drone, which aimed to streamline the inspection process in various industrial settings. This drone was designed to carry out inspections in hard-to-reach areas, ensuring safety and efficiency in industrial operations. I collaborated with the team to integrate advanced sensors and cameras into the drone, allowing it to capture high-resolution images and data for detailed analysis. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork and communication in a professional setting.
									
									Throughout my internship, Dr. Lawrenceâ€™s mentorship was instrumental in my growth. His expertise and guidance helped me navigate complex technical challenges and encouraged me to think critically and innovatively. I gained valuable insights into the practical applications of aerospace technology and the importance of sustainable practices in engineering.
									
									Overall, my internship at Garuda Aerospace was a transformative experience that significantly broadened my technical knowledge and professional skills. Working on innovative projects under the guidance of Dr. Daniel Lawrence has prepared me for future challenges and opportunities in the field of aerospace engineering.</p>
